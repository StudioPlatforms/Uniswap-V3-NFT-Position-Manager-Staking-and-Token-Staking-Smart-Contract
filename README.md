About the Project
This contract was developed as part of a partnership between 3D Studio Europe and Shinobi to provide a robust staking solution on the Shido Blockchain. This staking contract allows Shinobi's community to participate in staking activities, where they can earn rewards and contribute to the ecosystem's growth.

Features
Multi-Pool Staking: Supports multiple staking pools, each with unique reward tokens and APY (Annual Percentage Yield).
Secure Staking Mechanism: Includes cooldown periods, reentrancy protections, and a structured fee mechanism.
Configurable Reward System: Enables flexible reward distribution based on APY and Total Value Locked (TVL) in each pool.
Compatibility with Shido Blockchain: Tailored to work seamlessly on the Shido Blockchain, which is EVM-compatible.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Shinobi-Staking-Contract.git
cd Shinobi-Staking-Contract
Install Dependencies: (if using a local development environment like Hardhat)

bash
Copy code
npm install
Compile the Contract:

If using Remix, simply open the contract file and compile it.
Alternatively, use Hardhat to compile:
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat compile
Deploy the Contract:

Follow the instructions to deploy the contract on the Shido network, or refer to the documentation in this repository for further deployment steps.
